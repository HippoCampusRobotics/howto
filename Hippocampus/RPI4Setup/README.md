#Ubuntu 18.04 Installation RPI4
The image of Ubuntu 18.04 can be downloaded [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi).
The image should be 64-bit and can be installed on a micro SD-Card with at least 16 gb.
[Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is a great tool for copying the image on the SD-Card.

It is important that this version is only a server-version, which means there is no Graphical User Interface. Everything can be done using SSH.

After downloading and flashing the SD-Card the pi can be booted. Make sure to use a LAN cable the first time it is used.
