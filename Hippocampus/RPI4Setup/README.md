# Raspberry pi Setup

The Setup can be done with two different Operating systems. Ubuntu 18.04 and Raspberry Pi OS Buster.

Advantage Ubuntu 18.04: 
* Very easy to use in the first place and Supports Realsense-Library for Sensors

Disadvantage Ubuntu 18.04: 
* Sometimes not all drivers are up to date/working for every hardware on the RPI

Advantage Raspberry Pi OS: 
* The drivers for many hardware is fully supported. 

Disadvantage Raspberry Pi OS: 
* Realsense-Library not working properly
* takes longer to set-up ROS(has to be installed from source)
